# JSLibraryGreeter
js library which greets user.

Hey there,

Before I start:
This library has been inspired from the one shown by Mr Anthony Alicea in his course 'JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts'. 
I've learnt a lot in js from his course.
So i suggest interested viewers to opt for the course.

About the library:

The library generates formal and informal greetings when it gets a first and last name.

It supports multiple languages (currently four (en, es, fr, ge)) More will be added soon.

It can be reused. It is user-friendly. It supports jQuery.
